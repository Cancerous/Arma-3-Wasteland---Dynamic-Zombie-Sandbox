Celery Zombie spawning script
Author: Craig

How to use:
place the following into the init of any object or unit (not triggers or markers), or put it in a script and use any objects name

0=[any object on the map, besides tiggers and markers,number of zombies to spawn,spawntype] execVM "simpleZombieSpawn.sqf";

Example:

0=[Jim,20] execVM "simpleCeleryZSpawn.sqf";
